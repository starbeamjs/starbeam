/**
 * Build a library with TypeScript in the specified mode.
 *
 * This plugin uses swc (via `@swc/core`) to efficiently compile TypeScript to
 * JavaScript.
 *
 * ## Assumptions
 *
 * You are using at least TypeScript 5.0.
 *
 * You are using the (large) subset of TypeScript that can be compiled by
 * evaluating a single module and stripping out type-specific features. You are
 * not using features of TypeScript that require multi-module analysis to
 * determine how to compile a single module.
 *
 * - You should not use `const` enums, but if you do, they will be converted
 *   into normal enums.
 * - All import paths that refer to non-existent JavaScript modules (type-only
 *   modules) are imported using `import type`.
 * - All imports that do not refer to a JavaScript value are imported as part of
 *   an `import type` statement or are annotated with `type` (i.e. `import {
 *   map, type MapFn } from "map"`).
 *
 * ## Recommendations
 *
 * To ensure that your code satisfies these assumptions, we recommend the
 * following tsconfig options:
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>`verbatimModuleSyntax`: true</dt>
 *   <dd>
 *     You will get a TypeScript error if one of your imports is only
 *     used as a type but does not include the `type` specifier.
 *   </dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * We also recommend the use of `@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-imports` and
 * `@typescript-eslint/no-import-type-side-effects`. These auto-fixable lints
 * will error if you don't use `import type` on an import statement that is
 * never used as a value. These lints will also ensure that any named imports
 * that are only used as types are annotated with `type`.
 *
 * If you're using vscode, you can enable "source.fixAll" in
 * `editor.codeActionOnSave` and imports will automatically be updated if you
 * need to add or remove `import type`.
 *
 * ## Type Checking
 *
 * > **TL;DR** This plugin does **not** typecheck your code. It is intended to
 * > be run after verifying your code using tools such as `tsc` and `eslint` and
 * > after successfully running your tests.
 *
 * Now for the longer version...
 *
 * **Compiling** a library is a separate step from **verifying** the library.
 *
 * Conversationally, people refer to the process of verifying and compiling a
 * library as "the build" (i.e. "failing the build").
 *
 * This is largely an artifact of workflows in other languages, such as Java,
 * C++ and Rust. In these languages, the *compiler* performs a large amount of
 * verification before compilation can begin.
 *
 * Even in those environments, many projects perform additional verification
 * steps (such as linting and testing) before creating and publishing the
 * compilation artifacts.
 *
 * But in **our** environment, virtually the entire verification step can be
 * performed before the compilation step.
 *
 * > Adding to the confusion, the tool that you use to *verify* your TypeScript
 * > code is called `tsc`. Even more confusingly, `tsc` is intended to be a
 * > good-enough reference compiler for TypeScript code. In practice, though, it
 * > makes more sense to use `tsc` as part of a comprehensive *verification*
 * > strategy and to use other tools (such as `esbuild` or `swc`) to compile
 * > your TypeScript code.
 *
 * ## Verify Separately
 *
 * This plugin is intended to be used as part of a build process that runs the
 * verification step first, and only invokes the compilation step once the
 * verification step has completed.
 *
 * These same verification steps should run in your CI pipeline.
 *
 * During development, we recommend that you use the same verification tools in
 * your editor, which can help developers avoid submitting pull requests that
 * will fail verification.
