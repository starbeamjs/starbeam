The core concepts of Starbeam are documented in the [docs] for users of Starbeam.

The package READMEs have additional implementor-focused documentation:

- [@starbeam/shared]: Primitive Starbeam fundamentals. This package enables multiple
  copies of Starbeam to interoperate, including across major versions of Starbeam.
- [@starbeam/tags]: The core of Starbeam's demand-driven validation system.
- [@starbeam/reactive]: The implementation of Starbeam's fundamental reactive
  values (cells and formulas).
- [@starbeam/collections]: Starbeam's reactive collections: reactive
  implementations of JavaScript's built-in collections (object, array,
  `Map`, `Set`, `WeakMap`, and `WeakSet`).
