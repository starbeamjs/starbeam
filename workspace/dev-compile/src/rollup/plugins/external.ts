/**
 * A plugin that applies the default starbeam-dev externals rules to the builds
 * for the specified package.
 *
 * When an import is "external", it is left as-is in the built package. When an
 * import is "inline", it is combined with the built package's main file and
 * further optimized.
 *
 * In general, it's better to inline an import if any of the following are true:
 *
 * 1. It is only used by this package.
 * 2. Its exports are easy to optimize by a minifier in production builds (e.g.
 *    exports that are simple functions that have no behavior or simply return
 *    its argument). Functions that use `import.meta.env.DEV` guards around
 *    behavior that would be tricky to optimize are still good candidates for
 *    inlining.
 * 3. More generally, when inlining the import in production mode is likely to
 *    save more bytes than the bytes lost due to duplication.
 *
 * ## Rules
 *
 * 1. Relative imports: If the import starts with a `.`, then it is an inline
 *    import.
 * 2. Custom rules: If the `starbeam:inline` key in `package.json` specifies a
 *    rule for a dependency, use it. You can use custom rules to override any of
 *    the default rules below.
 * 3. [TODO] Custom workspace rules: If the `starbeam:inline` key in the
 *    `package.json` for the workspace root specifies a rule for a dependency,
 *    use it.
 * 4. Helper libraries: If the import is one of the well-known helper libraries,
 *    then it is an inline import.
 * 5. Absolute imports: If the import starts with `/`, then it is an inline
 *    import. This is because absolute imports are usually relative imports
 *    previously resolved by the build process. In general, you should not use
 *    absolute imports in your source code when using this plugin (and probably
 *    in general).
 * 6. Import map imports: If the import starts with `#`, then it is an inline
 *    import. Since import-map imports typically resolve to relative imports,
 *    the current behavior is to inline them.
 * 7. If the `starbeam:external` key in `package.json` specifies a rule for a
 *    dependency, use it.
 *
 * It would probably be more correct to attempt to resolve import map imports
 * and then apply the rules above to the resolved imports. Please file an issue
 * describing your situation if you need this.
 *
 * ## Well-Known Helper Libraries
 *
 * - `@babel/runtime/*`
 * - `tslib`
 * - `@swc/core`
 *
 * ## Manifest Rules (`starbeam:external` keys)
 *
 * The `starbeam:inline` key is either an array of rules or a rules object.
 *
 * ### Rule Pattern
 *
 * A rule pattern is a string, one of the following:
 *
 * - The name of a package listed in the `dependencies` or
 *   `optionalDependencies` field  of the `package.json` file
 * - A pattern that ends in a `*` (e.g. `@starbeam/*`) and matches the name of
 *   at least one package listed in the `dependencies` or
 *   `optionalDependencies`. The `*` matches one or more characters that are
 *   valid as part of an npm package name.
 * - The special pattern `(helpers)`. This matches all of the well-known helper
 *   libraries.
 *
 * ### Rules Array
 *
 * The easiest way to specify inlining rules is by specifying an array of
 * patterns.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "dependencies": {
 *     "react": "^18.2.0",
 *     "lodash": "^4.17.21"
 *   },
 *
 *   "starbeam:inline": ["lodash"]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Any patterns in the array will be configured to be inlined. These patterns
 * supersede the default behavior.
 *
 * ### Rules Object
 *
 * Each key in the object is a rule pattern, and the value is either "inline" or
 * "external".
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "dependencies": {
 *     "react": "^18.2.0",
 *     "lodash": "^4.17.21"
 *   },
 *
 *   "starbeam:inline": {
 *     "loadash": "inline"
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In this example, the `react` dependency is externalized, and the `lodash`
 * dependency is inlined.
 *
 * The default behavior is to externalize all dependencies, so you don't need to
 * specify "external" in a rules object unless you want to supersede a later
 * rule.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "dependencies": {
 *     "react": "^18.2.0",
 *     "lodash.map": "^4.17.21",
 *     "lodash.merge": "^4.17.21"
 *     "lodash.flat-map": "^4.17.21"
 *   },
 *
 *   "starbeam:inline": {
 *     "lodash.merge": "external",
 *     "lodash.*": "inline"
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In this example, `react` and `lodash.merge` are externalized, and
 * `lodash.map` and `lodash.flat-map` are inlined.
 *
 * ### Rule Objects in a Rules Array
 *
 * When you have a lot of inline rules and only a handful of externals
 * overrides, it's nice to be able to avoid repeating `: "inline"` over and over
 * again.
 *
 * In this situation, you can include rule objects in a rules array.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Instead of this:
 *
 * ```json
 * "starbeam:inline": {
 *   "lodash.merge": "external",
 *   "lodash.*": "inline"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can do this:
 *
 * ```json
 * "starbeam:inline": [
 *   { "lodash.merge": "external" },
 *   "lodash.*"
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * ## Matching Order for Custom Rules
 *
 * Custom rules are matched in the order they are listed in the
 * `starbeam:external` key.
 *
 * Earlier rules in the rule array take precedence over later rules. Earlier
 * rules in an rules object take precedence over later rules in the same rule
 * object.
 *
 * ## Development and Peer Dependencies
 *
 * Since development dependencies are not intended to be used at runtime, they
 * should never be imported from runtime code, and therefore should never be
 * included in the build.
 *
 * Since peer dependencies are intended to be supplied by a dependent package
 * (i.e. the package including the package you are building), they are always
 * external and should not be listed in the `starbeam:external` key.
 *
 * @param {PackageInfo} pkg
 * @returns {import("rollup").Plugin}
