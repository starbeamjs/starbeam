/**
 * A Resource is a two-level formula:
 *
 * - The first formula is the "resource constructor". It is evaluated to produce
 *   the inner formula, and also has an opportunity to register finalizers and
 *   link children.
 * - The inner formula is a regular formula.
 *
 * Whenever any dependencies of the first formula invalidate, the associated
 * finalizers and children are finalized.
 *
 * The inner formula is stateless. This means it can be freely evaluated without
 * worrying about its lifetime.

/**
 * A Resource instance is a stable value, but it has multiple possible internal layers of
 * invalidation.
 *
 * 1. The entire resource constructor can invalidate, which causes the resource to be cleaned up and
 *    the constructor to run again. If the resource is already set up, the setup function will run
 *    again once the resource is reinitialized.
 * 2. Setup handlers can invalidate, which causes their cleanups to run, and then for the setup
 *    handers to run again.
 * 3. The formula that represents the resource can invalidate, which simply causes the resource to
 *    invalidate.
 *
 * The trick of resources is providing a DSL that represents all of these three layers in a way that:
 *
 * 1. Naturally captures dependencies in all three layers.
 * 2. Provides a lexical structure that naturally gives access to longer lived values inside of
 *    shorter-lived closures (e.g. the long-lived cells that power a resource are in the outermost
 *    scope; they can be used inside of setup handlers, and variables created inside setup handlers
 *    are available inside cleanup handlers). The goal is to avoid introducing unnecessary nulls or
 *    forcing inner callbacks to mutate outer-scope variables that are initialized to null or
 *    undefined.
